# Hey There!

## if you see this, that means that Briyan has officially completed his asylum speedrun within a successful 4~ hours.

# Details?

The project is nothing in special particularly so you wont see or notice something unique in the PCB itself. The code is well uhm questionable, but thats the maximum you can get out of using the wrong parts in a wokwi simulation.
The shell of the pcb was speedrunned too using EasyEDA PRO but anyway Ill be 3d printing the case myself too so more scope for prototyping that asw
